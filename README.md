# Voting Dapp
Blockchain-based voting system to be used with polls/petitions related to the FCT Nova activities.
Only those whitelisted can participate and it's implied that only students who are currently enrolled in a program are whitelisted.
The system is supposed to facilitate a multi-directional communication between students and university administration
(like this: `students <-> students <-> teachers`, instead of classic `teachers -> students`).
### What's a Dapp?
Decentralized APPlication. Rather than using Front-end with Back-end, Dapp consists of Front-end with Blockchain, which means there's no centralized server
in which data could be altered or censored. Everything is transparent and written once and forever.
### Smart contract location
Voting smart contract is deployed & verified in the Goerli testnet: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x9d8c40823a3bcd379f923cd82d34855482d64345#readContract
